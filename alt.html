		<h1>My Process</h1>
		<h2>Development - 5 Ws</h2>
		<p><b>Who -</b> Anyone. Anyone that is looking to bring back small buisness and are into high quality products.</p>
		<p><b>What -</b> A responsive web app to give people a easy way to navigate on all platforms.</p>
		<p><b>Where -</b> Anywhere that there is internet access. Most users will probably use at home.</p>
		<p><b>Why</b> People are looking to support local smaller buisness now more than ever. People like to shop online to save time during their busy work schedule and may not have access to some products in there local area.</p>
		<div style="background-color: white;">
		<h2>User Flow</h2>
		<p>I developed my user flow based on what my 5 Ws were and what functionality was essential to be incorporated within the application.</p>

		<h2>Mid Fidelity</h2>
		<p>After I developed my low fidelity wireframes, I created my mid fidelity to get the layout coherent and added more detail to get a better idea of what the final design was going to look like.</p>

		<h2>User Feedback</h2>
		<p>
		- Would like to see more functionality. Maybe what the search page looks like when trying to find an item?<br>

		- Feels like it doesn’t stand out enough from Etsy. So wants to see more functionality or more reasons to use this application instead.<br>

		- Would like to see a filter functionality added.<br>

		- Would like to product names on the home page under images to get more information without having to click on the image.<br>

		- Doesnt know how he would leave a review on the product’s page.<br>

		- No feedback if product was added to cart. </p>

		<p>Product page offers user to add to cart and continue shopping and it also enables the user to have a barter offer using an alternative currency for people limited on money.</p>
		<h3>Retrospective</h3>
		<p>Throughout the process of creating this application I tried my hardest to make this different than other competitior apps like Etsy and Amazon. Eventhough this is a ecommerce application it is also a community building application so it is very important to show users how the application is giving back and helping the community grow.</p>
		<p>The main lesson I learned throughout this design process was how to make an already saturated market of apps stand out and how to include different functionality that other apps do not have.</p>
