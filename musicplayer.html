    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="smaller_para">Welcome to the 80s is music player app that brings the user back to the good old days of the 1980s. It features all of the most popular artist from the decade along with lesser known artists from that time.</p>

    <hr>
    <div style="background-color: white;">
      <h2>App Research</h2>
      <p>I conducted research on other music apps to see what functionality that I liked and what I wanted to add to my app. The two apps that I decided to do an analysis of is Spotify and Musi.
	  </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 style="color: #2BC716">Spotify</h2>
	  <p>When researching spotify I liked how the homepage was customized to what your previous listening session was and I liked how all of the saved songs and content was sent to the your library for easy access. Spotify enables the user to create a customize playlist very easily and that was a feature I wanted to include on my app.
	  </p>
	<h2 style="color: #EF8E2D">Musi</h2>
	  <p>A main feature in Musi that I liked that I didnâ€™t see on spotify was music video content. The 1980s is know to have classic music videos as this was the decade of MTV so I thought this was essential feature to include.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Low - Fidelity</h2>
      <p class="smaller_para">After doing my competitive on other music player apps when I sketched the wireframes I thought of the essential functions that I wanted to includ in the app which was: the ability to add and create a playlist, search for music &amp; have a custom home page based off of previous searches.

      <h2>Mid Fidelity</h2>
      <p class="smaller_para">After I developed my low fidelity wireframes, I created my mid fidelity version to get the layout coherent and added more detail to get a better idea of what the final design was going to look like.

    <p class="smaller_para">Search and watch the top music videos from the 1980s!</p>
    <h2>Key Insights&nbsp;</h2>
    <p class="smaller_para">A key insight I can take away from each stage is that there is a lot of attention to detail in a user interface that could make or break your design. From making the icons to selecting the proper design patterns there are a lot of important decisions that need to be made as you create your app and if your missing certain key elements it could lead to a lot of user error. </p>
